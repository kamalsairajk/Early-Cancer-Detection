# Early-Cancer-Detection

Our aim was to develop a different version of CNN which can be used to detect leukemia from ALL
images. We not only focused on getting predictions from the models we have created but also developed the
model to be more reliable in producing accurate predictions This method of white blood cell classification is
promising and can be used in diagnostic systems for leukemia for early detection of the disease.

The work presented describes a new system for the diagnosis of leukemia in blood sample images using
a Convolutional Neural Network and cross validation technique namely k fold. The dataset I worked on
is relatively small and can lead to overfitting. Hence I have performed the proposed method on a dataset
which is largely augmented in order to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the proposed CNN architecture.
Based on the results obtained, it is possible to say that this methodology has been robust in comparison
with others.
